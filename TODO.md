- individual state-stores: would be nice if it had something to describe the backing input types
- stack caching opportunities if they're called multiple times in the rake tasks
- consider httparty vs rest-client
- Use the invalid yaml syntax to figure out more things in rake tasks that needs to be lazy loaded
- Like the idea of maybe splitting out the syntax elements to a different gem. Gem installation & management would become easier
- missing spec around reports?
- Look into muting the reporter as dev default: https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter
- Look into getting HieraDB wrapper to read .yml files
